/**
 * To build a state machine you should build a maybe inner class derived from {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine}. This class builds the frame for all states.
 * Any state should be defined as inner class derived from either ...or  
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple}: A simple state with transitions, an optional entry- and an exit-action.
 * <li>{@link org.vishia.states.StateComposite}: It contains more as one sub states.
 * <li>{@link org.vishia.states.StateParallel}: It contains more as one {@link org.vishia.states.StateComposite} for parallel behavior: 
 *   Any StateComposite contains a sub statemachine which works parallel if this state is active. 
 * </ul>
 * See example pattern {@link org.vishia.states.example.StateExampleSimple}.
 * <br><br>
 * Any state can contain an entry- and an exit action which can be build either ... or with:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Overriding the method {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple#entry(EventObject)} respectively {@link StateSimple#exit()}.
 * <li>Set the association {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple#entry} respectively {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple#exit} 
 * with an Implementation of {@link org.vishia.states.StateAction} which can be located in any other class, 
 *   usual as inner anonymous class. In that cases the entry and exit can use data from any other class.
 * </ul>  
 * <br><br>
 * Any state can contain some transitions which are variables of type {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple.Trans}.
 * If a transition should contain an action the transition variable should be an anonymous inner derived class 
 * of {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple.Trans} which overrides the {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple.Trans#action(EventObject)}.
 * The other possibility is assignment of action code with {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple.Trans#setAction(StateAction)}
 * </ul>
 * Any state should override the method {@link org.vishia.states.StateSimple#checkTrans(EventObject)}. This method checks all conditions
 * which can fire any transition and returns the selected transition instance or null if nothing should fire. This method should not execute
 * actions. It should only test the condition and select the transition. The actions are done in the calling environment of this method,
 * lastly if {@link #processEvent(EventObject)} of the whole statemachine is invoked.
 * <br><br>
 * On construction of the whole {@link StateMachine} all state classes are instantiated and listed in the StateMachine. 
 * All transitions are evaluated and transformed in a unified list of transition objects.
 * For all transitions the necessary exitState()- and entryState() operations are detected and stored, so that complex state switches
 * are executed correctly. The designation of destination states in the written source code uses the class names of the states. 
 * The transition evaluation process on construction searches and lists the instances of the states.
 * <br><br>
 * A state instance can be gotten with {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine#getState(Class)}
 * <br><br>
 * The {@link StateMachine} can be quested whether a state is active yet: {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine#isInState(Class)} 
 * or {@link StateMachine#isInState(Class)}
 * <br><br>
 * <br>Creation of a StateMachine with or without a timer and an event queue</b>:<br>
 * One can execute the state machine in 2 modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>State execution inside a thread which processes events. That thread can process more as one state machine. 
 *   The limit is: If many events can be occured, the execution of all state transitions should be able to done in a limited time. 
 *   The advantage is: All state machines are executed in the same thread.
 *   The transitions are <em>fibers</em> of that thread. They are non-interrupt-able. If more as one state machines work with the same data,
 *   no additional mutexes are necessary.
 * <li>State execution inside the calling thread. That is the more simple variant. 
 *   Events to trigger the state machine are possible but not necessary. The user should have control over mutual exclusion access to data 
 *   if some more threads are used.  
 * </ul>
 * In the first case an instance of {@link EventTimerThread#EventThread(String)} are necessary which is a parameter for the constructor
 * {@link #StateMachine(EventTimerThread, EventTimerMng)}.
 * <br><br>
 * If an {@link EventTimerThread} is used an instance of {@link EventTimerMng} is possible and recommended . 
 * The timer manager can manage any number of time orders.
 * It sends an {@link EventTimerMng.TimeEvent} to this StateMachine it the time is expired.
 * <br><br>
 * The state machine can be animated using {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine#applyEvent(EventMsg2)} with or without events
 * by given a null argument, for example cyclically if an {@link EventTimerThread} is not used.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * To see how transitions and timeouts should be written see on {@link StateSimple.Trans} and {@link StateSimple.Timeout}.
