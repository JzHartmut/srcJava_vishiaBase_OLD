 * A variable may be a entity in a byte-datagram, see {@link org.vishia.byteData.ByteDataSymbolicAccess.Variable}.
 * The quality of a variable and the kind of access is described in the implementation.
 * The user can access to a substantial variable with this interface.
 * <br><br>
 * It is possible to have one list or index with variables which are found in several data storage types,
 * for example in Java-data using {@link org.vishia.reflect.FieldVariableAccess} or in data from files.
 * use Container <code>List<VariableAccess_ifc></code> or <code>Map<String,VariableAccess_ifc></code>.
 * To work as integral whole, this interface supports all of them.
 * <br><br> 
 * Variables may assembled in an array structure. The implementation knows about the array property of any variable.
 * To support an indexed access all methods can have additional index parameter. If they are not need, let it empty.
 * If indices are given but they are not expected, an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} or an {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 * may be thrown.
