/**This class helps to access to binary data without any given structure or without a head of data.
 * <br><br>
 * Use this class only for instantiation but not as reference if children should be added,
 * only if the structure has not a head:
 * <pre>
 * ByteDataAccess accMy = new ByteDataAccessSimple(data);  //we have not head data
 * addMy.addChild(anyChild);                               //but there is a structure with children
 * <pre>
 * <br><br>
 * Use this class as reference to access to any byte position:
 * <pre>
 * ByteDataAccessSimple accMy = new ByteDataAccessSimple(data);  //any access to byte data necessary
 * accMy.setIntVal(ix, 3, value);      //sets the int value with 24 bit, it is an example
 * float var = accMy.getFloatVal(24);  //gets the bytes from position 24 and present them as float.
 * <pre>
 * In that case you can add children too, there are added from position 0. But it is not a good style
 * to mix the both aproaches.
