/**This class is a base class to control the access to binary data.
 * The binary data may typically used or produced from a part of software written in C or C++.
 * Therewith the binary data are struct-constructs. Another example - build of datagram structures.
 * <br>
 * This class is a base class which should be derived for user's necessities. 
 * The methods {@link #getInt16(int)} etc. are protected. That should prevent erratic free accesses to data 
 * on application level. A derived class of this class structures the software for byte data access.
 * <br><br> 
 * It is able to support several kinds of structured data access:<ul>
 * <li>Simple C-like <code>struct</code> are adequate mapped with a simple derived class of this class, 
 *     using the protected commonly access methods like {@link #_getLong(int, int)} with predefined indexes 
 *     in special methods like getValueXyz().
 * <li>Complex <code>struct</code> with nested <code>struct</code> inside are mapped 
 *     with one derived class per <code>struct</code>, define one reference per nested struct 
 * <li>Base <code>struct</code> inside a <code>struct</code> (inheritance in C) can be mapped with 
 *     extra derived classes for the base struct and usind the
 *     {@link #assignCasted(ByteDataAccessBase, int, int)}-method.
 * <li>A pack of data with several struct may be mapped using the {@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase)}-method.
 *     Thereby a parent should be defined, and the structs of the pack are children of this parent. 
 *     That structures need not be from the same type.
 * <li>packs of struct with parent are able to nesting, it is able to construct as a tree of pack of structures. 
 *     The parent of the pack is the tree node. It is likewise a XML tree. 
 *     The data may be also transformed to a XML data representation
 *     or the data structure may be explained with a XML tree, but they are not
 *     XML data straight.
 * </ul>
 * This application possibilities show a capable of development system to access binary data. 
 * The other, hand made way was calculate with indices of the byte[idx] specially user programmed. 
 * This class helps to make such complex index calculation needlessly. 
 * One struct at C level corresponds with one derivated class of ByteDataAccessBase. 
 * But last also a generation of the java code from C/C++-header files containing the structs is able to.
 * So the definition of byte positions are made only on one source. The C/C++ is primary thereby. 
 *      
 * <br>
 * The UML structure of such an class in a environment may be shown with the
 * followed object model diagram, <br>
 * <code> <+>---> </code>is a composition,
 * <code> <>---> </code>is a aggregation, <code> <|---- </code>is a inherition.

 * </pre>
 *
 * This class is the base class for ByteDataAccess. It works without dynamic methods proper for C usage.
 * All variables are package private because they should be changed only with methods of this class.
 * <br><br>
 * <h2>Initialization and instances</h2>
 * The root instance to access to data should be initialized with
 * <pre>
 MyByteDataAccessRoot accessRoot = new MyByteDataAccessRoot(); 
   //... invokes super.ByteDataAccessBase(lengthHead);
 accessRoot.assign(myData, dataLength);
 * </pre>  
 * Any instances which represents a sub structure in data can be created as re-useable instances, which can be added
 * as child of the root instance or as child of any already added child on demand:
 * <pre>
 MySubStruct subStruct = new SubStruct();  //an instance for accessing 
   ....
   accessRoot.addChild(subStruct);         //adds on current position.
   int value = subStruct.getValuexyz();    //now can access the data.
   ....  //later on code:
   accessOther.addChild(subStruct);        //reuse the instance for access
   int value = subStruct.getValueAbc();    //access other data.
 * </pre>
 * The instances of this derived class are helper to access to the data, they are not container for the data. 
 * The data are stored in a <code>byte[]</code>-array 
 * 
 * 
 * <br>  
 * <h2>children, currentChild, addChild</h2>
 * Children are used to evaluate or write different data structures after a known structure. 
 * The children may be from several derived types of this class. 
 * With children and children inside children a tree of different data can be built or evaluated.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase)}: adds a child with its head size
 * <li>{@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase, int)}: adds a child with a given length
 * <li>{@link #addChildEmpty(ByteDataAccessBase)}: adds a child with its head size for writing, set all data to 0.
 * <li>{@link #addChildEmpty(ByteDataAccessBase, int)}: same with given size of child.
 * <li>{@link #addChildFloat(float)}, {@link #addChildInteger(int, long)}: writes the value and increments the #ixChildEnd after it.
 * <li>{@link #addChildString(CharSequence)}, {@link #addChildString(CharSequence, String)}: writes the String.
 * <li>{@link #getChildFloat()}, {@link #getChildDouble()}, {@link #getChildInteger(int)}: reads the value at {@link #ixNextChild}
 *   and increments the {@link #ixNextChild}.
 * <li>{@link #getChildString(int)} reads a String and increments the {@link #ixNextChild}
 * <li>{@link #addChildAt(int, ByteDataAccessBase)}, {@link #addChildAt(int, ByteDataAccessBase, int)}: Used if the byte structure
 *   is known. Adds a child not at #ixNextChild but at the given position. 
 * </ul>
 * Mechanism and indices see {@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase, int)}.   
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Expand, check</h2>
 * If an instance is set for read or change, a given number of valid data bytes are known. The instance is marked as 'non expandable', see
 * The data should be assigned with
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #assign(byte[], int)} with given length, not expandable
 * <li>{@link #assign(byte[], int, int)} at a defined position in the data usefull for special cases.
 * With the given length >= the sizehead of the {@link ByteDataAccessBase#ByteDataAccessBase(int)} 
 * the internal flag {@link #bExpand} is set to false.
 * </ul>
 * If an instance is set for write, the maximal number of bytes is limited by the size of data (byte[]).
 * The data should be assigned with:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #assignClear(byte[])} as empty instance, the data are cleared in its whole length.
 * <li>{@link #assign(byte[], int)} with 0 as length argument as instance which only knows the head data, but the data are not cleared.
 * </ul>
 * In both cases the internal flag {@link #bExpand} is set to true. It means that the {@link #ixEnd()} which is set initially to the {@link #sizeHead}
 * is increased if a child is added.
 * <br><br>
 * If an instance of this is set to non expandable,
 * an exception is thrown if a children is added after the given length. If an instance is designated as 'expandable' the end index
 * #ixEnd is increased by adding children till the length of data as its maximal value.
 * <br><br>
 * With the operations {@link #sufficingBytesForNextChild(int)} or {@link #getMaxNrofBytes()} it can be tested whether a child can be added
 * with its known length.   
 * <br>

  /**The version, history and license. 
   * <ul>
   * <li>2016-01-24 Hartmut chg: All {@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase)} etc. returns false if {@link #setException(boolean)} is false and the child cannot be added.
   *   If the user invokes setException(false) the user must check the return value of the add...() operations.
   * <li>2015-08-08 Hartmut chg: Change of concept: prevent Exception if the environment does not process it: Tested on {@link #setIdxtoNextCurrentChild(int)}:
   *   This routine can throw an Exception, but it can return -1 on error too, possible with an exception message. Therewith more operations can be disabled by quest of return value.
   * <li>2015-08-08 Hartmut chg: {@link #setLengthElement(int)} should set the ixEnd of the child and the ixNextChild of the parent
   *   but does not influence the this.ixNextChild. See test cases (TODO). This is fixed and all usages of this class for 
   *   org.vishia.insp* are tested well by testing the reflection access and GUI.  
   * <li>2015-08-08 Hartmut new: {@link #getChildInt(int)},  {@link #_getInt(int, int)} for 32 bit operation, {@link #_getLong(int, int)} uses 64 bit. 
   *   Used for in derived classes also. The 64-bit-operation is not proper for 32-bit embedded systems in C. TODO use it also if the size argument is <=4.
   * <li>2015-04-12 Hartmut docu and fineTuning: 
   * <li>2015-03-08 Hartmut chg: ixChild removed, unnecessary, instead {@link #currChild}, proper for debug. 
   * <li>2014-09-05 Hartmut chg: Some problems fixed in C-Application. Runs in Java. Meaning of {@link #bExpand}
   * <li>2014-09-05 Hartmut chg: Designation with some Java4C annotation.
   * <li>2014-09-05 Hartmut chg: now based on a {@link #charset} of type {@link java.nio.charset.Charset}. In C it is a dummy yet.
   *  In Java the Charset can be used immediately, more simple.
   * <li>2014-09-05 Hartmut bugfix: Some references changed from ByteDataAccess to ByteDataAccessBase.
   * <li>2014-09-05 Hartmut chg: {@link #getString(int, int)} now may contain 0-character. Only the 0-bytes on end are removed because they are fill-bytes
   *   for a 4-byte-alignment. _getString(int, int) removed because it was the same.
   * <li>2014-08-23 Hartmut chg: Member idxFirstChild removed, the information is contained in {@link #sizeHead}. 
   * <li>2014-08-23 Hartmut new: this class ByteDataAccessBase works without virtual methods (overrideable), it is proper for usage in C-language
   *   and it is not necessary. The {@link #sizeHead} is set by construction. Only for the compatible now deprecated {@link ByteDataAccess} the sizeHead 
   *   is able to set via the package-private {@link #_setSizeHead(int)}.  
   * <li>2014-01-12 Hartmut new: Java4C.inline for C-compilation. 
   * <li>2013-12-08 Hartmut new: {@link #ByteDataAccessBase(int, int)} as super constructor with given head and data size.
   *   {@link #addChild(ByteDataAccessBase)} accepts an initialized not used child. Uses {@link #kInitializedWithLength}.
   *   That is the possibility to work without dynamic linked methods {@link #specifyLengthElement()} etc. for proper work
   *   especially for C usage. The overridden methods {@link #specifyEmptyDefaultData()}, {@link #notifyAddChild()} etc.
   *   are proper to use in C too with the concept of the dynamic linked methods, but there does not be necessary.
   *   It is an optimizing for C. Maybe in future the {@link #specifyLengthElement()} and {@link #specifyLengthElementHead()}
   *   may be depreciated because the new variant of initialized children is better to use, more simple for usage. 
   *   But it should be compatible with older versions. 
   * <li>2013-12-08 Hartmut chg: {@link #reset(int, int)} is protected now and has a second parameter. necessary public? 
   * <li>2012-12-15 Hartmut chg: Some changes are done which cleans up this class. If any problem occurs, the {@link ByteDataAccessOld}
   *   can be used. It is compatible with the last version before this changes.
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>The currentChild is not necessary. The only reason to have that association is: changes of size in parent
   *     force changes in the current child. But it is contrary: The changes should be done in the child and should affect
   *     the indices in all parents which should be known all in the child. If a child is added and it is never used furthermore
   *     then an unnecessary dangling reference exists. If the child instance is reused and detach is not called, mistakes are happen.
   *   <li>the next() and rewind() are removed. It is an unused old concept.  
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2012-04-07 Hartmut new: {@link #reset(int)}, some comments.
   * <li>2012-03-00 Hartmut Note: compare it with java.nio.ByteBuffer. But a ByteBuffer is abstract.
   * <li>2010-12-20: Hartmut chg: remove the toString-method using StringFormatter, because it is too complex for C-usage.
   *   The toString was only able to use for debugging.
   * <li>2010-02-02: Hartmut new:  getChildFloat(), getChildDouble().
   * <li>2010-01-16: Hartmut chg:  setBigEndian in now public. It should be better because the same user data may be interpreted in both versions depending on a parameter.
   * <li>2005..2009: Hartmut: some changes
   * <li>2005 Hartmut created
