   * <li>2014-06-10 Hartmut chg: {@link ExecuteLevel} implements {@link FilePath.FilePathEnvAccess} now
   *   instead this, therewith a {@link JZtFileset#listFiles(List, JZtFilepath, boolean, org.vishia.util.FilePath.FilePathEnvAccess)}
   *   does not need an accessPath, it may be empty respectively null.
   * <li>2014-03-07 Hartmut new: All capabilities from Zmake are joined here. Only one concept!
   *   This file was copied from srcJava_Zbnf/org/vishia/zmake/Userfilepath.
   *   The data of a file are referenced with {@link #data}. The original fields are contained in
   *   {@link JZtScript.Filepath}. Both are separated because the parts in JZcmdScript are set completely
   *   by parsing the script. This class contains the access methods which uses the reference {@link #zgenlevel}.
   * <li>2013-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link FileSystem#normalizePath(CharSequence)} called in {@link #absbasepath(CharSequence)}
   *   offers the normalize path for all absolute file paths. 
   * <li>2013-03-10 Hartmut new: Replace wildcards: {@link #absfile(JZtFilepath)} (TODO for some more access methods)
   * <li>2013-02-12 Hartmut chg: dissolved from inner class in {@link ZmakeUserScript}
