/**Interface common use-able to append or returns an information about the instance adequate meaning like toString() for debugging and showing. 
 * <br><br>
 * Advantage in comparison of toString(): If a complex information should be necessary only one time a StringBuilder is need to create
 * which gathers all info. Often the content is used on the fly, for example for
 * <pre>
 *   StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder(100);
 *   anyInstance.infoAppend(buffer);
 *   buffer.append("some more information");
 *   System.out.append(buffer);
 * </pre> 
 * If this information should be stored it is possible persistent as reference of type {@link java.lang.CharSequence}. 
 * A reference which may changed the StringBuilder content should not be used. 
 * <br>
 * On the other hand
 * {@link #infoAppend(StringBuilder)}.toString() builds a persistent String of this information. The copy of content is done here at least only.
 * <br><br>
 * The info should end with a semicolon. Therewith it is able to parse or use for example in an Excel-csv-Format.
