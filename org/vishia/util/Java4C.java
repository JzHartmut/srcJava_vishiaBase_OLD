   */
  public @interface StackInstance{}
  
  
  /**A reference in C refers always this instance type though the reference has a lesser type.
   * In Java the methods are override-able normally, because a <code>final</code> designation
   * to prevent overriding is written only if the ability to override should prevent in inheriting classes.
   * Therefore the most of methods should be called in a override-able mode, using the method table-call.
   * But that is not economically in calculation time, and in some cases it is unnecessary. 
   * It is against the C-style of programming and testing.
   * <br><br>
   * The difference provocation is: In a object oriented architecture interfaces should be used 
   * to divide software in independent parts. Interfaces are the main choice to do so, base classes
   * are the other choice. So specific implementations can be implemented without cross effects.
   * But therefore the overridden methods appear as the only one solution. 
   * <br><br>
   * In opposite to Java the independence of modules are realizes in C using forward declarations of methods
   * in header files and their implementation in separated C-files (compiling units). The linker
   * have to link only with knowledge of the labels (method names) without knowledge of any implementation details.
   * This form of independence can't realize the polymorphism in opposite to interfaces and super classes, 
   * only the aspect of independence is regarded. But this aspect is the prior aspect mostly. 
   * <br><br>
   * The solution of this provocation is found in the following way: If it is known, that a reference
   * references a determined instance in the C-implementation, it can be designated with a
   * <code>@ java2c=instanceType:"Type".</code>-annotation in its comment block. Another way is 
   * using a final assignment <code>final IfcType ref = new Type();</code>, what generates 
   * an embedded instance. Than the Java2C-translator
   * generates a non-overridden calling of the method of the designated instance type 
   * for using that reference. The annotation is the decision written in the source 
   * in knowledge of the implementation goals. In Java it isn't active. So in Java several implementations
   * can be implemented, at example for testing.     
   * <br><br>
   * If the user is deceived in the usage of the reference, it is not detected in Java 
   * neither by compiling nor by testing, because it isn't active there. 
   * But it should be attracted attention in testing at C-(implementation)-level.
   * The Java2C-compiler may test the correctness of the designation <code>@ java2c="instancetype".</code>,
   * because it translates the assignments too. But than all temporary used references should be designated
   * too. That don't may be helpfully.
   * <br><br>
   * But the designated reference can be tested in Java in Runtime, whether at least the designated type
   * is referenced, using a <code>reference instanceof Type</code>-Java-sourcecode. 
   * Than fatal errors are excluded, only if the instance is from a derived type, it isn't detected.
   * The <code>instanceof</code>-check needs a small part of calculation time, 
   * if the instance is from the expected type. Such tests are slowly only if the instance is from a far derived type,
   * than the implementation type should be searched in reflections. In the current case
   * only 2 indirect accesses and a compare operation is necessary in the implementation of
   * <code>instanceof_ObjectJc(ref, reflection_Type).</code>  
   * <br><br>
   * A reference, which has a dedicated instance type, is determined in its {@link FieldData#instanceClazz}- element.
   * This element is able to seen in the stc-File of the translated class with notation <code>instance:<Type></code>
   * as part of the <code>fieldIdents {...}</code>.
   * <br><br>
   * The method-call is translated to C using the {@link Method#sImplementationName}.
