/**This class wraps any {@link java.lang.CharSequence} and provides comparable features like {@link java.lang.String}
 * for commonly usage. The difference to java.lang.String is: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A String is guaranteed immutable, the char sequence
 *   which is referred from this class is immutable only if the programming does guarantee it.  
 * <li>The advantage in comparison to java.lang.String is: If a char sequence is prepared in a {@link java.lang.StringBuilder}
 *   or such adequate, it does not need an own buffer to hold the string though the StringBuilder's buffer
 *   won't be changed by any other program part. It increases the speed for string operations especially
 *   if there is a large String.
 * </ul>
 * This class can be used as wrapper for both, mutable or immutable char sequences. The attribute {@link #isUnmated}
 * designates whether the char sequence is referred only by this class. This flag should be set and guaranteed
 * by the user's programming only.
 * <br><br>
 * A CharSequence can be cast to a StringBuilder if its implementation class is a StringBuilder or a new StringBuilder
 * can be build with it. The content of the StringBuilder can be changed. If it is unmated, no other usages
 * can be affect, only the same one which changes it. In this case the CharSequence can be changed for further usage.
