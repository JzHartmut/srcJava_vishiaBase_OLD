/**Base class for all events in a event driven software or for communications.
 * Events may contain data. Special data are contained in derived classes of this. The type of the event
 * can be checked using <code>event instanceof DerivedEvent</code>. The id may be only a hint.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>What is a event driven software</b>?<br>
 * There are 4 types of organization of the cooperation in a multi thread system or in a distributed system:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>request, wait and notify</b>: The action which should be done by another thread or in another remote device
 *   is requested. Then the requesting thread waits for the execution (for response, for answer, for notify). 
 *   
 * <li><b>request and poll</b>: The action is requested. Then the requesting thread does any other action, 
 *   it can't be used the result from the request yet.
 *   But the thread polls cyclically (may be for some milliseconds or longer) the result of the requested order.
 * <li><b>callback</b>: The action which should be done by another thread or in another remote device
 *   is requested. With the request a callback reference is given. If the request is executed (received response etc),
 *   the other thread calls the callback method. In the callback method the results of the request can be processed.
 * <li><b>event driven</b>: The action is requested usual by sending an event to the executer instance. 
 *   The requested thread does nothing with any response in the immediate programming environment. 
 *   It requests only. But the executer instance may send an event back if it has finished the execution
 *   or if any other messages should be given.<br>
 *   Events are stored stored in a queue firstly. The queue will be checked by the 'event execution thread'.
 *   It is possible to have only one event execution thread in the system. In this case the execution will be done
 *   in the same thread, but to any later time (if the event is gotten from the queue).<br>
 *   There may be some more event execution threads, for example a thread which organizes communication.
 *   The execution of any request and the execution of the response is binded to the thread, 
 *   which polls the receivers event queue.<br>
 *   It is possible too to request any action non-event-driven, maybe by sending a request via Ethernet communication
 *   or adequate. But the response may be event-driven. The receiver thread of the communication
 *   puts the event in the queue. The execution of the response is done in the event-queue-thread.
 *   This is a proper mechanism to decouple activity. If the receiver thread would execute anything
 *   in another module, this execution may be hanging or may cause any exceptions which disturbs 
 *   the receiving thread so the whole receiving functionality may hang.  
 * </ol>
 * This 4 types may be present in a users program. The following remarks should be recognized:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>request wait and notify</b>: This is the simplest and basic methodology for inter-thread-cooperation,
 *    supported by the basic operations Object.wait() and Object.notify() as basic feature provided in Java.
 *    <br>
 *    The waiting thread can't execute any other things while waiting. A timeout of waiting may be good 
 *    for exception situations. 
 *    <br>
 *    A user may use this methodology for simple functionalities in the application software. But it needs
 *    an extra thread if other things should be done also. Especially in a graphic environment (which is event driven
 *    for graphic operations), a wait for less milliseconds may be ok, but if the response is delayed
 *    or it isn't received, the whole graphic execution is hanging on. (Do you know this effect in some
 *    applications on PC operations systems?).   
 *    <br>Therefore it may be recommended that this methodology should not be used as the favorite solution.
 *    in application programming.
 *    <br>The wait and notify is proper for basic implementations for example to organize a event driven system.
 *    The thread waits for events in the queue. If any other thread put an event in the queue, it notifies
 *    the waiting thread. That event execution thread has only one mission: providing the events to its destinations.
 *    If there are no events, it should wait and sleep.
 * <li><b>request and poll</b>: This methodology may be used in cyclic execution systems for example for
 *   analog-like controlling of signals. The cyclic execution tests results from communication or inter-thread-communication
 *   in any cycle of execution. 
 * <li><b>callback</b>: This is a simple methodology to prevent waiting. But the callback method is executed 
 *   in the other thread, which is responsible to the execution of the request or which is the receiving thread
 *   of any communication with a remote device. Maybe some thread mutex mechanism should be necessary.
 * <li><b>event driven</b>: This methodology needs a system support in user space: The event execution thread. 
 *   That thread polls the event queue. It waits if the queue is empty. If an event is gotten, it is
 *   distributed to its destination. The destination is any instance of any class which offers a the 
 *   event processing method. 
 *   <br>
 *   The event driven methodology can be esteemed as the best for complex systems.     
 * </ol>  
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Usage of this Event class</b>:<br>
 * This class supplies a common use-able base for event driven programming. It hasn't any dependencies 
 * to other classes of this package or component except {@link EventConsumer} and {@link EventThread}. 
 * (It may be good if this class is a member of the java/lang package).
 * The event mechanisms are well known and used in some Java applications for example in graphic (AWT, SWT)
 * or in special frameworks. That event classes are similar, but they are embedded in their environment.
 * If they are used, unnecessary dependency are caused. <br>
 * This class supports event driven programming in the language C too. It is designed to use in simple C applications
 * which where translated with the vishia Java2C translator. Thats why the usage of inheritance 
 * for any kind of events isn't the first choice. This Event class contains enough data for simple and usual
 * usages.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Usage for callback</b>:<br>
 * A request should be called with an reference to an instance to this Event class as parameter. 
 * This Event class contains the reference to the callback instance {@link #callback}. 
 * The callback instance implements the {@link EventConsumer}-interface. In this manner the request receiver
 * can invoke a callback using {@link #callback}.{@link EventConsumer#processEvent(Event)}. Note that this callback
 * is executed in the request receiver's thread.

 *      |                  it is a callback             |
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Usage for event driven mechanism</b>:<br>
 * The difference between callback and event driven is marginal but substantial. Instead invocation of
 * a callback in the other thread, the event is put in a queue. The event execution thread polls the event
 * and invokes the callback method to the destination class to consume the event. The difference is only:
 * The event is stored in a queue, the callback is invoked by another thread. But this difference is
 * substantial.

 * <br><br>
 * <b>Request and response in an event driven system</b>
 * In a common event driven system their isn't a thinking of 'request' and 'response'. Any event inducing
 * is independent of any other event. But usual mechanism uses 'request' and the associated 'response'.
 * For that methodology it is possible to give the event instance as parameter of the request already.
 * The event parameter contains the {@link #callback} for the response. This may be a instance in knowledge
 * of the requesting instance (maybe an inner class for implementation of {@link EventConsumer})
 * or the requesting instance itself. So the requested instance should not be known the requester permanently,
 * but only for the pending request.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Remote device, communication</b>:<br>
 * If any action should be executed in any other device which is connected via any communication maybe
 * via Ethernet, or serial or any other special, the request for the execution has to be sent. This request
 * can contain this Event class as parameter for the response. <br>  
 * The execution occurs independently in the other device then. The communication may be work with
 * request and response. If the action is received and accepted, a response will be sent back which may
 * contain any answer data. The response of the device is received by the receiver thread of the communication.
 * <br>
 * The communication should store and manage a association between request to the other device and response
 * from the device. The association may be realized using a sequence, order or commission number. If the
 * associated response is received, the Event of the request is found out using the commission or sequence
 * number. Then the communication-receive-thread can use the Event instance to invoke the callback
 * or put the event in the queue of dst.
