/**This class contains sorted references of objects (values) with a sorting key (usual String or Integer) 
 * in one or more tables of a defined size. 
 * <ul>
 * <li>This class can be used similar like {@link java.util.TreeMap}. 
 *   In opposite to a {@link java.util.TreeMap} the key need not be unique for all values.
 *   More as one value can have the same key. The method {@link #get(Object)} defined in 
 *   {@link java.util.Map} searches the first Object with the given key. 
 *   The method {@link #put(Comparable, Object)} replaces an existing value with the same key like defined in Map
 *   where the methods {@link #add(Comparable, Object)}, {@link #addBefore(Comparable, Object, Object)}
 *   and {@link #append(Comparable, Object)} puts the new value with an existing key beside the last existing one.  
 * <li>There is a method {@link #iterator(Comparable)} which starts on the first occurrence of the search key
 *   or after that key which is one lesser as the key.
 *   It iterates both to the end or backward of the whole collection. The user can check the key in the returned {@link java.util.Map.Entry}
 *   whether the key is proper. In this kind a sorted view of a part of the content can be done.
 * <li>The container consist of one or more instances of tables which have a limited size. If a table in one instance is filled,
 *   two new instances will be created in memory which contains the half amount of elements and the original
 *   instance is changed to a hyper table. The size of the instances are equal and less. It means, the search time
 *   is less and the memory requirement is constant. In this kind this class is able to use in C programming
 *   with a block heap of equal size blocks in an non-dynamic memory management system (long living
 *   fast real time system).    
 * </ul>
 * The inner class {@link Table} contains the table of objects and the table of key of type Comparable. 
 * The tables are simple arrays of a fix size.
 * <br>
 * An instance of Table class may be either a hyper table which have some children, 
 * or it is a end-table of keys and its references.
 * An end table may have a parent, which is a hyper table, and some sibling instances.
 * If there isn't so, only the end-table exists. It is, if the number of objects is less than 
 * the max capacity of one table, typical for less data. 
 * In that case, the data structure is very simple. Commonly a search process should regard 
 * the tree of tables. But the tree is not deep, because it is a square function. 
 * With a table of 100 entries, a 2-ary tree may contain up to 10000.
 * <br>
 * Objects with the same key can stored more as one time.
 *   
 * <br> 
 * This concept have some advantages:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A system of simple arrays for the key and a parallel array of the associated object
 *     allows fast search using a binary search algorithm. 
 *     It is a simple algorithm. Only less memory objects are needed. 
 *     It doesn't need nodes for TreeMap etc. 
 *     It is a simple layout for fast embedded control applications. 
 * <li>But using only one array of keys and one array of objects, 
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>first, the number of objects are limited or a large portion of memory should be provided,
 *   <li>second, if a new object is inserted, and the amount of objects is large, 
 *       a larger calculation time of System.arraycopy() would be necessary.
 *   </ul>
 * <li>Therefore the portioning in more as one table needs no large memory objects. 
 *     If the number of objects is increased, a additional new memory object with limited size 
 *     is necessary - no resize of existing object.
 * <li>The calculation time for insertion an object is limited because one table is limited,
 *     also if the number of objects is large.
 * <li>If thread safety is necessary, only that table should be locked or exclusive copied, 
 *     which is touched, for a limited time too. So the number of clashes is less. 
 *     In the time this class doesn't support thread safety, but it is planned in two ways, 
 *     using synchronized and using the lock free atomic mechanism. 
 * <li>Using lock free programming, the change of data should be done in an copy of the table.
 *     This copy have less memory size.
 * <li>The limited number of memory space is convenient for the application in fast real time systems.
 * </ul>

  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2016-10-15 Hartmut bugfix: because of the root table is instanceof {@link IndexMultiTable}, a value in {@link IndexMultiTable_Table#aValues} 
   *   which is type of {@link IndexMultiTable} has failed. It was recognized as a sub table with the simple check 
   *   <code>tableStart.aValues[idx] instanceof IndexMultiTable_Table</code> etc. Now it is checked whether the value is not an instance of IndexMultitable itself.
   *   The root table is not the point of quest but a sub table. That is not an instance of IndexMultiTable. 
   *   On the other hand a sub table is never a user value because {@link IndexMultiTable_Table} is package private and not free for usage.
   *   
   * <li>2016-10-15 Hartmut bugfix: The usage of <code>IndexMultiTable.super</code> works in Oracle-Java version 8.102, but not in a lesser version.
   *   To save compatibility it is avoided. Sometimes a typed meta variable is the better solution in any case.    
   * <li>2016-09-25 Hartmut chg: The root element is removed, instead this class extends a Table which is the root table.
   *   Only one advantage: 1 level lesser for debug-show of the data. But that may be proper for deep nested trees.
   *   For the change: The inner class Table is moved to an own {@link IndexMultiTable_Table} class.
   *   Some delegate methods are overridden now (clear), therefore super.clear() is called, to prevent circular invocation.
   *   No functional changes.
   * <li>2015-11-09 Hartmut bug: {@link #put(Comparable, Object)} fails in a constellation where insertion in the first child table, 
   *   {@link Table#splitIntoSibling(int, Comparable, Object)} with ix=0. The key was not updated in the parent table.
   *   fix: Using {@link Table#setKeyValue(int, Comparable, Object)} with check whether it is ix=0 and the parent key should be updated.
   * <li>2015-07-09 Hartmut chg: All methods are synchronized now because instances are used in more as one thread usual.
   *   The non-synchronized variant may be a special case. It has some more less calculation time.
   *   Idea: Offer non-synchronized methods with special name to save calculation time for applications
   *   which's instances are guaranteed not used in more as one thread.    
   * <li>2015-07-05 Hartmut bugfix: The calculation of {@link Table#sizeAll} was faulty. {@link Table#check()} improved,
   *   it checks the sizeAll and checks all child tables. Calculation of sizeAll improved. 
   * <li>2015-03-07 Hartmut bugfix false instanceof check, sub-tables has not worked.
   * <li>2014-12-21 Hartmut chg structure: Now a {@link Table} is an own instance. Improved and simplified. 
   * <li>2014-12-20 Hartmut new The iterator is a ListIterator now with {@link ListIterator#hasPrevious()} etc.
   *   The advantage and usage: Set the iterator to a expected point with {@link #iterator(Comparable)} and traverse back- and forward.
   *   There are some changes in algorithm. 
   * <li>2014-01-12 Hartmut chg: {@link #sortin(int, Comparable, Object)} new Algorithm
   * <li>2014-01-12 Hartmut chg: toString better for viewing, with all keys 
   * <li>2013-12-02 Hartmut new: Implementation of {@link #remove(Object)} was missing, {@link #searchInTables(Comparable, boolean, IndexBox)}
   *   restructured. It returns the table and index, able to use for internal searching. 
   * <li>2013-09-15 Hartmut new: Implementation of {@link #delete(int)} and {@link EntrySetIterator#remove()}.
   * <li>2013-09-15 Hartmut chg: rename and public {@link #search(Comparable, boolean, boolean[])}.  
   * <li>2013-09-07 Hartmut chg: {@link #put(Comparable, Object)} should not create more as one object
   *   with the same key. Use add to do so.
   * <li>2013-08-07 Hartmut improved.
   * <li>2013-04-21 Hartmut created, derived from {@link IndexMultiTableInteger}.
   * <li>2009-05-08 Hartmut corr/bugfix: IteratorImpl(IndexMultiTableInteger<Type> firstTable, int startKey) used in iterator(startkey):
   *                    If a non-exakt start key is found, the iterator starts from the key after it. 
   *                    If no data are available, hasnext() returns false now. TODO test if one hyperTable contains the same key as the next, some more same keys!
   * <li>2009-04-28 Hartmut new: iterator(key) to start the iterator from a current position. It is the first position with the given key. 
   *                    corr: Some empty methods are signed with xxxName, this methods were come from planned but not implemented interface
   *                    meditated: implement ListInterface instead Interface to supply getPrevious() to iterate starting from a key forward and backward.
   *                    corr: binarySearch self implemented, regarding the first occurrence of a key.
   * <li>2009-04-26 Hartmut meditated: Several key types in one file isn't good! The search routines are optimal only if the key type is fix.
   *                                There are some adequate classes necessary for int, long keys.
   *                    docu
   *                    chg: Using of class AllocInBlock to get the size of a block.
   *                    corr: Now more deepness as 2 tables is programmed and tested. Older versions support only 2 tables.
   *                          It was 1000000 entries max. with a table size of 1000.
   * <li>2009-03-01 Hartmut new: IndexMultiTableInteger(int size, char type): in preparation of using, functionality not ready yet.
   *                    planned: Type may be int, long, String, size are able to choose. The arrays should be assigned not as embedded instances in C. 
   *                    new: method get() does anything, not tested in all cases.
