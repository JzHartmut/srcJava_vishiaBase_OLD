 * The source is that class, which has transmitted the event.
 * Usual an event which were transmitted has no more connection to the source of it.

 * For debugging it may be a point of interest which instance is the source of an event.

 * This is a class, not an interface, because it contains a name for debugging.

    @Override public void notifyConsumed(){}
    @Override public void notifyRelinquished(){}
  };
 * </pre>
 * The bodies of the methods may access to any data of the environment class.
