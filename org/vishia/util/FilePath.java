/**This class holds a path to a file with its parts: base path, directory path, name, extension, drive letter etc
 * and supports getting String-paths in several forms - absolute, relative, name only, extension, with slash or backslash etc.
 * It supports using of script variables.
 * 
 * For building the absolute path or using script variables the user should provide an implementation 
 * of the {@link FilePathEnvAccess}
 * which supports access to String-given variables and the current directory of the user's environment.
 * This interface is implemented in the JZcmd environment.
 * <br><br>
 * <b>The local path</b>:<br>
 * If you write <code>any/Path:local/path/file.ext</code> then <code>any/Path</code> is the so named base path 
 * and <code>local/path</code> is the local directory. The <code>':'</code> separates the path in that 2 parts.
 * Regarding the drive designation of windows, the <code>':'</code>-separator for base and local path
 * is expected from the 3. position of a String given path. 
 * On 2. position it is the separator after the drive letter:
 * <pre>
 *   D:base/path:local/path/name.ext
 * </pre>  
 * <ul>
 * <li>For example in C-compilation object-files can be stored in sub directories of the objects destination directory 
 *   which follows this local path designation.
 * <li>Another example: copying some files from one directory location to another in designated sub directories.
 * </ul> 
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Common path and access path</b>:<br> 
 * If this file entry is member of a {@link FileSet}, the file set can have a common path.
 * This instance can contain a relative path, an {@link FilePath} instance as access path can determine
 * where the files are located. Therefore some methods works with this 2 arguments. 
 * The separation between the base path and the local path can be found in any of that prefix paths:
 * <pre>
 *   accessPath / commonPath / scriptVariable / localDir
 *                     :
 *                     ^---anywhere of that may have a basePath. All other are act as localDir.                    
 * </pre>
 * Of one of that paths are absolute it determines the path. If the commonPath is absolute, the accessPath is not regarded
 * for that. The most left of the prefix paths uses the {@link FilePathEnvAccess#getCurrentDir()} to build an absolute path
 * if it is required. 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Drive letter or select path</b>: On windows systems a drive letter can be used in form <code>A:</code>.
 *   The path should not be absolute. For example <code>"X:mypath\file.ext"</code> describes a file starting from the 
 *   current directory of the <code>X</code> drive. Any drive has its own current directory. A user can use this capability
 *   of windows to set different current directories in special maybe substitute drives. This feature is not supported here
 *   because there is only one current directory. 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Drive letter as select path</b>:  
 *   It may be possible (future extension) to use the capability of drive letters independent of windows in this class. 
 *   That should be a feature of {@link FilePathEnvAccess}.
 *   If the path starts with a drive letter, the associated path is searched in the parents drive list. 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Absolute path</b>: If this entry starts with slash or backslash, maybe after a drive designation for windows systems,
 *   it is an absolute path. If an absolute path is requested
 *   calling {@link #absfile()} or adequate and the path is not given as absolute path, then the current directory is used
 *   as prefix for the path. The current directory is a property of the {@link FilePathEnvAccess#getCurrentDir()}. 
 *   The current directory of the operation system is not used for that. 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>operation systems current directory</b>: In opposite if you generate a relative path and the executing system
 *   expects a normal path then it may use the operation system's current directory. But that behavior is outside of this tool.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Slash or backslash</b>: The user script can contain slash characters for path directory separation also for windows systems.
 *   It is recommended to use slash. The script which should be generate may expect back slashes on windows systems.
 *   Therefore all methods which returns a path are provided in 2 forms: <b>With "W" on end</b> of there name it is the <b>Windows version</b>
 *   which converts given slash characters in backslash in its return value. So the generated script will contain backslash characters.
 *   Note that some tools in windows accept a separation with slash too. Especial in C-sources an <code>#include <path/file.h></code>
 *   should be written with slash or URLs (hyperlinks) should be written with slash in any case.    
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Return value of methods</b>: All methods which assembles parts of the path returns a {@link java.lang.CharSequence}.
 *   The instance type of the CharSequence is either {@link java.lang.String} or {@link java.lang.StringBuilder}.
 *   It is not recommended that a user casts the instance type to StringBuilder, then changes it, stores references and
 *   expects that is unchanged. Usual either references to {@link java.lang.CharSequence} or {@link java.lang.String} are expected
 *   as argument type for further processing. If a String is need, one can invoke returnValue.toString(); 
 *   <br><br>
 *   The usage of a {@link java.lang.CharSequence} saves memory space in opposite to concatenate Strings and then return
 *   a new String. In user algorithms it may be recommended to use  {@link java.lang.CharSequence} argument types 
 *   instead {@link java.lang.String} if the reference is not stored permanently but processed immediately.
 *   <br><br> 
 *   If a reference is stored for a longer time in multithreading or in complex algorithms, a {@link java.lang.String}
 *   preserves that the content of the referenced String is unchanged in any case. A {@link java.lang.CharSequence} does not
 *   assert that it is unchanged in any case. Therefore in that case the usage of {@link java.lang.String} is recommended.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Handling of Wildcards</b>:<br>
 * The method {@link #expandFiles(List, FilePath, FilePath, FilePathEnvAccess)} resolve wild cards with respect to
 * really found files in a specified file location.
 * <br>
 * In opposite the method {@link #absfileReplwildcard(FilePath, FilePathEnvAccess)} or {@link #localfileReplwildcard(StringBuilder, FilePath)}
 * replaces the given parts of another FilePath on positions of wildcards especially to build a new file.
 * <br>
 * All simple get methods {@link #localfile(FilePathEnvAccess)} etc. returns the wildcards like given.

{
  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>   
   * <li>2017-09-01 Hartmut new: A FilePath can refer a {@link FileSet} variable or especially a {@link JZtxtcmdFileset} variable.
   *   Then it is not a FileSet but it is a reference to an included FileSet. On {@link FileSet#listFiles(List, FilePath, FilePathEnvAccess, boolean)}
   *   it will be recognized and unpacked. It is on runtime. Note: On script compilation time the variable content may not existent yet.
   *   The variable is only given as String.    
   * <li>2014-06-22 Hartmut note: The possibility of wildcard in the local path (not only "/** /" for allTree) 
   *   is not described, designed and tested completely. 
   * <li>2014-06-22 Hartmut chg: Set all fields private. The fine fragmentation to drive, ... name, ext was done
   *   in 2005 because in the XSLT language it is more simple to concatenate the parts and the ZBNF parser is capable
   *   to fragment. From Java language view it may be better to fragment the given path only in basepath and localpath whereby the basepath
   *   starts with the "D:/" if given and the localpath contains "local/path/name.ext". In preparation the positions of
   *   name, ext can be stored in int-fields. Then it is more simple to return for example the {@link #localfile(FilePathEnvAccess)}
   *   without using a StringBuilder. It saves memory and calculation time. The {@link #name()} is a substring only.
   *   That change can be done later to faster the algorithm. Firstly the class {@link ZbnfFilepath} should be removed.
   *   Therefore it is set to depreciated just now. This class sets the fine graduated parts.
   *   All get methods can be changed maybe without side effects. Because that the fields are private up to now.
   * <li>2014-06-20 Hartmut chg: accessPath: if it contains {@link #someFiles} then use the directory only.
   *   It may be a special case. The usage of wildcard in access path is non constructive. 
   * <li>2014-04-05 Hartmut dissolved from {@link org/vishia/cmd/JZcmdFilepath}, usage more universal.     
   * <li>2014-03-07 Hartmut new: All capabilities from Zmake are joined in JZcmd. Only one concept!
   *   The file {@link org/vishia/cmd/JZcmdFilepath} was copied from former <code>srcJava_Zbnf/org/vishia/zmake/Userfilepath</code>.
   *   The data of a file in the JZcmd context are referenced with {@link org.vishia.cmd.JZtxtcmdFilepath#zgenlevel}. 
   *   The original fields are contained in this class. Both are separated because the parts in JZcmdScript are set completely
   *   by parsing the script. This class contains the access methods which uses the reference to {@link FilePathEnvAccess}
   *   as parameter.
   * <li>2013-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link FileSystem#normalizePath(CharSequence)} called in {@link #absbasepath(CharSequence)}
   *   offers the normalize path for all absolute file paths. 
   * <li>2013-03-10 Hartmut new: Replace wildcard: {@link #absfile(JZtxtcmdFilepath)} (TODO for some more access methods)
   * <li>2013-02-12 Hartmut chg: dissolved from inner class in {@nolink ZmakeUserScript}
   * <li>2012-12-29 Hartmut chg: A {@link FilePath} is independent from a target and describes a non-completely relative path usually.
   *   The path is completed, usual as absolute path, if the {UserFileSet} is used in a target. The {TargetInput} of a target
   *   determines the location of the file set by its {@nolink TargetInput#srcpathInput}. The {@nolink UserFilepath} of all inputs are cloned
   *   and completed with that srcpath for usage. The {@nolink UserTarget#allInputFiles()} or {@nolink UserTarget#allInputFilesExpanded()}
   *   builds that list. Usage of that files provide the correct source path for the files of a target's input.
   * <li>2012-12-08 Hartmut chg: improve access rotoutines.
   * <li>2012-11-29 Hartmut new: The ZmakeUserScript.UserFilePath now contains all access routines to parts of the file path
   *   which were contained in the ZmakeGenerator class before. This allows to use this with the common concept
   *   of a text generator using org.vishia.zTextGen.TextGenerator. That Textgenerator does not know such
   *   file parts and this UserFilepath class because it is more universal. Access is possible 
   *   with that access methods {@link FilePath#localfile()} etc. To implement that a UserFilepath
   *   knows its file-set where it is contained in, that is {@link UserFilepath#itsFileset}. 
   *   The UserFileset#script knows the Zmake generation script. In this kind it is possible to use the
   *   common data of a file set and the absolute path.
   * <li>2011-02-20 Hartmut Re-engineering of Zmake, class ZmakeUserScript. The basic was the XML implementation of zmake. 
   *   The content of this user script was present in an XML tree after parsing instead in this java class. 
   *   It was processed with a XSLT translator. The new Zmake concept is attempt to use Java and a textual generation 
   *   from java data instead XSLT, it is more flexible.
   * <li>2005 Hartmut creation of this class in an XML environment parsed with ZBNF, used for generation of ANT-Zmake-scripts.

   * To implement this true table with less tests the algorithm is recursive. If this has not a {@link #basepath},
   * this routine is called recursively for an existing {@link ScriptVariable#filepath} or for the existing
   * commonPath or accessPath each with given left side element (variable with common and access, common with access).
   * If any of the elements commonPath or accessPath have not a base path, 
   * the {@link #localFile(StringBuilder, FilePath, FilePath)} is added too.
   *         
   * @param uRet If not null then append the result in it.  
   * @param generalPath if not null then its file() is used as part before the own basepath
   *   but only if this is not an absolute path.
   * @param accesspath a String given path which is written before the given base path if the path is not absolute in this.
   *   If null, it is ignored. If this path is absolute, the result is a absolute path of course.
   * @param returnFileIfNoBasepath null or false, then returns the basepath. 
   *   true then returns the whole file path if an extra basepath is not given or it returns the basepath. 
   *   In the last case the element is set to false.
   *   This argument is used for recursive calling to get the basepath() from a scriptVariable given
   *   FilePath or from a accessPath or commonPath. The basepath is the whole path from such an
   *   prefix element if the prefix has not a basepath itself. 
   * @return the whole base path of the constellation.
   *   Either as absolute or as relative path how it is given.
   *   The return instance is the given uRet if uRet is not null. 
   *   It is a StringBuilder if the path is assembled from more as one parts.
   *   It is a String if uRet is null and the basepath is simple.
   *   A returned StringBuilder may be used to append some other parts furthermore.
