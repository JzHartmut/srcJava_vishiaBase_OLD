   * <li>2013-02-25 Hartmut new: The {@link Output#bUseText} stores whether the output channel uses the text. 
   *   The {@link #dispatchMsg(int, boolean, int, OS_TimeStamp, String, Va_list)} gets a text from configuration
   *   only if it is need.
   * <li>2013-02-25 Hartmut new: The {@link #sendMsgVaList(int, OS_TimeStamp, String, Va_list)} counts whether a message can't be queued.
   *   it is used to output a 'lostmessage' message in {@link MsgDispatcher#dispatchQueuedMsg()}.
   * <li>2012-08-22 Hartmut new {@link #setMsgTextConverter(MsgText_ifc)}. It provides a possibility to work with a
