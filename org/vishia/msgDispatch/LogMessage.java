/**An interface to write messages or log entries to any destination.
 * The basic idea is: The messages and logs are dispatched via a number. 
 * The number have two aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The number identifies the message or kind of log entry.
 * <li>The number is used to select receiver(s) of the message or log entry.
 * <ul> 
 * Any message can be dispatched to one or more destinations which evaluate or store the message,
 * or the message can be ignored. A log entry is a special using of a message: 
 * It should only written in a log file or display, without any forcing of reactions.
 * But a log can also be dispatched to one or more destinations (log files) or can be ignored.
 * Whether a message is only a log, or the message forces actions at destination, 
 * is determined by the destination itself. The source produces the message only. 
 * The source doesn't determine the using of it.
 * <br><br>
 * A Message comprises the possibility of "coming" and "going" of the associated state. 
 * If the message are "coming", the state is activated, if it is "going", the state is released.
 * To tag the state, the identNumber is given positive for "coming" and negative for "going". 
 * It is a simple economization of calling arguments, because mostly or by first using, 
 * there is no state identify of the message. Only some chosen messages have a state identify,
 * or a state comes with the message in continue of implementations.
 * <br><br> 
 * A Message has a text. 
 * The text is used immediate if it is a textual saved log entry, readable by human. 
 * The text may be unused if the message forces actions in a technical system. 
 * The text may be unused also, if a destination medium has its own text processor.
 * If the message should be evaluated not only as human read, 
 * the identNumber have to be the correct identification. 
 * The text should only be a comment, human readable.
 * <br><br> 
 * A message has some values. The values should be displayed in the textual representation. 
 * The <code>String.format(String, Object...)</code>-Method should used to display the text.
 * But the values may be also important for evaluating the message in the destination. 
 * The meaning of the values depends on the kind of message, identified by the number.    
 * <br><br> 
 * A message has a time stamp. The time stamp may be built automatically 
 * at the time while creating the message. But it is possible to supply a time stamp to the message.
 * It is important, if the signal or event associated to the message has a deterministic time stamp
 * created at example in hardware. Following common usages the time stamp is an absolute time 
 * in milliseconds, represented by a <code>java.util.Date</code> Object. 
 * In a realtime system, compiled with C-Language, the struct Date may have a microsecond resolution
 * and another base year, but it should be absolute.
