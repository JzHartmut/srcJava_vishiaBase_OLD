  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2012-09-14 Hartmut new: {@link CallbackFile}, {@link #walkFileTree(FileRemote, FileFilter, int, CallbackFile)}. 
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut chg: Now it is an interface, not an abstract class, only formal.
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut new: {@link #setLastModified(FileRemote, long)}. 
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut bugfix: {@link #getChildren(FileRemote, FileFilter)} here only abstract.
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut new: {@link #openInputStream(FileRemote, long)}
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut new: {@link #getChildren(FileRemote, FileFilter)} implemented here.
   * <li>2012-08-12 Hartmut chg: up to now this is not an interface but an abstract class. It contains common method implementation.
   *   An derivation (or implementation of the interface before that change) may not need other base classes.
   * <li>2012-08-03 Hartmut chg: Usage of Event in FileRemote. 
   *   The FileRemoteAccessor.Commission is removed yet. The same instance FileRemote.Callback, now named FileRemote.FileRemoteEvent is used for forward event (commision) and back event.
   * <li>2012-07-28 Hartmut new: Concept of remote files enhanced with respect to {@link FileAccessZip},
   *   see {@link FileRemote}
   * <li>2012-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link Commission#newDate} etc. 
   *   for {@link FileRemote#chgProps(String, int, int, long, org.vishia.fileRemote.FileRemote.CallbackEvent)}.
   * <li>2012-01-09 Hartmut new: This class extends from Closeable, because an implementation 
   *  may have an running thread which is need to close. A device should be closeable any time.
   * <li>2012-01-06 Hartmut new {@link #refreshFileProperties(FileRemote)}. 
   * <li>2011-12-31 Hartmut new {@link Commission} and {@link #addCommission(Commission)}. It is used
   *   to add commissions to the implementation class to do in another thread/via communication.
   * <li>2011-12-10 Hartmut creation: Firstly only the {@link FileRemoteAccessorLocalFile} is written.
