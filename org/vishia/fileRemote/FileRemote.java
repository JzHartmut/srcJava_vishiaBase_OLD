/**This class stores the name and some attributes of one File. 
 * The file may be localized on any maybe remote device or it may be a normal file in the operation system's file tree.
 * The information of the file (date, size, attributes) are accessible in a fast way without opeation system access. 
 * But therefore they may be correct or not: A file on its data storage can be changed or removed. 
 * The data of this class should be refreshed if it seems to be necessary. 
 * Such an refresh operation can be done if there is enough time, no traffic on system level. 
 * Then the information about the file may be actual and fast accessible if an application needs one of them.
 * <br><br>
 * In comparison to the standard {@link java.io.File} the information are gotten from the operation system in any case, 
 * the access is correct but slow.
 * <br><br>
 * A remote file should be accessed by {@link FileRemoteAccessor} implementations. It may be any information
 * on an embedded hardware, not only in a standard network. For example the access to zip archives are implemented by
 * {@link FileAccessZip}. A file can be present only with one line in a text document which contains path, size, date.
 * In this case the content is not available, but the properties of the file. See {@link org.vishia.util.FileList}.
 * <br><br>
 * This class stores the following information (overview)
 * <ul>
 * <li>path, timestamp, length, flags for read/write etc. like known for file systems.
 * <li>parent and children of this file in its file tree context.
 * <li>time of last refresh: {@link #timeRefresh} and {@link #timeChildren}. With this information
 *   an application can decide whether the file should be {@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)}
 *   or whether its propertees seems to be actual valid.   
 * <li>Aggregation to its {@link FileRemoteAccessor}: {@link #device} to refresh.
 * <li>Aggregation to any data which are necessary to access the physical file for the 
 *   FileRemoteAccessor implementation. This is an instance of {@link java.io.File} for local files.
 * <li>Aggregation to its {@link FileCluster}: {@link #itsCluster}. 
 *   The cluster assures that only one FileRemote instance exists for one physical file inside an application.
 *   In this case some additional properties can be stored to the FileRemote instance like selected etc.
 *   which are seen application-width.
 * <li>Information about a mark state. There are some bits for simple mark or for mark that it is
 *   equal, new etc. in any comparison. This bits can be used by applications.  
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>How to create instances of this class?</b><br>
 * This class contains a static reference to a {@link #clusterOfApplication} which is used as default. 
 * It means there is only one cluster. But you can create a special {@link FileCluster} for some FileRemote instances too.
 * The FileCluster prevents more instances of FileRemote for the same physical file and supports
 * additional properties for a file as instance of FileRemote.  
 * If you have any other FileRemote instance, it knows its {@link #itsCluster}.
 * You can create a child of an existing file by given path using {@link #child(CharSequence)}, {@link #subdir(CharSequence)}
 * or {@link #child(CharSequence, int, int, long, long, long)}
 * whereby the child can be a deeper one, the path is a relative path from the given parent. This FileRemote instance
 * describes a possible existing file or maybe a non existing one, adequate like creation of instances
 * of {@link java.io.File}. Note that on {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)} this instance will be removed
 * from the children list if it is not existing.
 * <br>
 * You can get any FileRemote instance with any absolute path calling {@link FileCluster#getFile(CharSequence)}.
 * This instance will be created if it is not existing, or it will be get from an existing instance
 * of this RemoteFile inside the cluster. The instance won't be deleted if the physical file is not existing.
 * For example you can create <pre>
 *   FileRemote testFile = theFileCluster.getFile("X:/MyPath/file.ext");
 * </pre>  
 * This instance is existing independent of the existence of such a physical file. But <pre>
 *   if(testFile.exists()){....
 * </pre>
 * may return false.   
 * <br><br>
 * This class inherits from {@link java.io.File} in the determination as interface. The advantage is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class File defines a proper interface to deal with files which can be used for the remote files concept too. 
 *   No extra definition of access methods is need.
 * <li>Any reference to an instance of this class can be store as reference of type java.io.File. The user can deal with it
 *   without knowledge about the FileRemote concept in a part of its software. Only the refreshing
 *   should be regulated in the proper part of the application. 
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * <b>Concepts of callback</b>: <br>
 * This class offers some methods to deal with directory trees:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #refreshAndMark(int, boolean, String, int, int, FileRemoteCallback)} marks files for copy, move or delete.
 * <li>{@link #refreshAndCompare(FileRemote, int, String, int, FileRemoteProgressTimeOrder)} compares two trees of files.
 * <li>{@link #copyChecked(String, String, int, CallbackEvent)} copies some or all files in a tree.
 * <li>{@link #deleteChecked(CallbackEvent, int)} deletes some or all files in a tree.
 * </ul> 
 * This operations may need more seconds, sometimes till minutes if there are a lot of files in a remote device with network access.
 * To show the progress two startegies are used:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FileRemoteCallback}: It is a callback interface with methods for each file and each started and finished directory.
 * <li>{@link FileRemoteProgressTimeOrder}: It is an instance which is filled with data. The time order is handled by a timer
 *   which activates it for example in a cycle for 200 milliseconds. The user extends this base class with the showing method. 
 *   In a time range of 200 milliseconds there can be executed some more files, for example 1000 if the file system is local. 
 *   Not any file forces to be showed. Therewith calculation time is saved.  
 * </ul>
 * The user can provide one of that, both or no instance for showing. 
 * Handling of a event driven communication need one event per file. It is too much effort if the file system is fast.
 * That is tested in the past but not supported furthermore.

  /**Version, history and license.
   * <ul>
   * <li>2015-07-04 Hartmut chg: Values of flags {@link #mTested}, {@link #mShouldRefresh}, {@link #mRefreshChildPending}
   *   {@link #mThreadIsRunning} to the highest digit of int, to recognize for manual viewing. That flags should not used in applications.
   *   Remove of flags for comparison, the bits are used and defined inside {@link FileMark} for a longer time.  
   * <li>2015-05-30 Hartmut new: {@link #copyDirTreeTo(FileRemote, int, String, int, FileRemoteCallback, FileRemoteProgressTimeOrder)} 
   * <li>2015-05-25 Hartmut new: {@link #clusterOfApplication}: There is a singleton, the {@link FileCluster}
   *   is not necessary as argument for {@link #fromFile(File)} especially to work more simple to use FileRemote
   *   capabilities for File operations.
   * <li>2014-12-20 Hartmut new: {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackFile)} used in Fcmd with an Thread on demand, 
   *   see {@link org.vishia.fileLocalAccessor.FileAccessorLocalJava7#walkFileTree(FileRemote, boolean, boolean, String, int, int, FileRemoteCallback)}
   *   and {@link FileRemoteAccessor.FileWalkerThread}.
   * <li>2014-07-30 Hartmut new: calling {@link FileAccessorLocalJava6#selectLocalFileAlways} in {@link #getAccessorSelector()}
   *   for compatibility with Java6. There the existence of java.nio.file.Files is checked, and the File access
   *   in Java7 is used if available. So this class runs with Java6 too, which is necessary in some established environments.
   * <li>2013-10-06 Hartmut new: {@link #getChildren(ChildrenEvent)} with aborting a last request.
   * <li>2013-09-15 Hartmut new: {@link #getChildren(ChildrenEvent)} should work proper with
   *   {@link java.nio.file.Files#walkFileTree(java.nio.file.Path, java.util.Set, int, java.nio.file.FileVisitor)}.
   *   The event should be called back on 300 ms with the gathered files. If the access needs more time,
   *   it should be able to have more events to present a part of files, or to abort it.
   *   The concept is tested in java-6 yet.  
   * <li>2013-09-15 Hartmut new: Ideas from Java-7 java.nio.Files in the concept of FileRemote: 
   *   The FileRemote is an instance independent of the file system and stores the file's data. 
   *   If Java-7 is present, it should be used. But the Java-6 will be held compatible.
   * <li>2013-08-09 Hartmut chg: The {@link MarkMask_ifc} is renamed, all methods {@link #setMarked(int)}
   *   etc. are named 'marked' instead of 'selected'. 
   *   It is a problem of wording: The instances are only marked, not yet 'selected'. See application
   *   of this interface in {@link org.vishia.gral.widget.GralFileSelector}: A selected line is the current one
   *   or some marked lines.
   * <li>2013-08-09 Hartmut new: implements {@link MarkMask_ifc} for the {@link #cmprResult}.
   * <li>2013-07-29 Hartmut chg: {@link #moveTo(String, FileRemote, CallbackEvent)} now have a parameter with file names. 
   * <li>2013-05-24 Hartmut chg: The root will be designated with "/" as {@link #sFile}
   * <li>2013-05-24 Hartmut new {@link #cmprResult}, {@link #setMarked(int)}
   * <li>2013-05-05 Hartmut new {@link #isTested()}
   * <li>2013-05-05 Hartmut new {@link #mkdir()}, {@link #mkdirs()}, {@link #mkdir(boolean, CallbackEvent)}, 
   *   {@link #createNewFile()}. 
   *   TODO some operation uses still the super implementation of File.
   *   But the super class File should only be used as interface.
   * <li>2013-05-05 Hartmut chg: {@link #child(CharSequence)}  accepts a path to a sub child.
   *   New {@link #isChild(CharSequence)}, {@link #isParent(CharSequence)}.  
   * <li>2013-05-04 Hartmut redesigned ctor and order of elements. sDir does not end with "/" up to now.
   * <li>2013-04-30 Hartmut new: {@link #resetMarkedRecurs(int, int[])}
   * <li>2013-04-29 Hartmut chg: {@link #fromFile(FileCluster, File)} has the FileCluster parameter yet, necessary for the concept.
   *   This method is not necessary as far as possible because most of Files are a FileRemote instance yet by reference (Fcmd app)
   * <li>2013-04-28 Hartmut chg: re-engineering check and copy
   * <li>2013-04-26 Hartmut chg: The constructors of this class should be package private, instead the {@link FileCluster#getFile(String, String)}
   *   and {@link #child(String)} should be used to get an instance of this class. The instances which refers the same file
   *   on the file system are existing only one time in the application respectively in the {@link FileRemoteAccessor}. 
   *   In this case additional information can be set to files such as 'selected' or a comparison result. It is in progression.  
   * <li>2013-04-21 Hartmut new: The {@link #flags} contains bits for {@link #mChecked} to mark files as checked
   *   with {@link #check(FileRemote, CallbackEvent)}. With that the check state is able to view.
   * <li>2013-04-21 Hartmut new: The {@link #flags} contains bits for {@link #mCmpContent} etc. for comparison to view.  
   * <li>2013-04-21 Hartmut new: {@link #copyChecked(CallbackEvent, int)} in cohesion with changes 
   *   in {@link org.vishia.fileLocalAccessor.Copy_FileLocalAcc}.
   * <li>2013-04-12 Hartmut chg: Dedicated attributes for {@link CallbackCmd#successCode} etc.
   * <li>2013-04-07 Hartmut adapt: Event<?,?> with 2 generic parameter
   * <li>2013-04-07 Hartmut chg: {@link CallbackEvent} contains all the methods to do something with currently copying files,
   *   for example {@link CallbackEvent#copyOverwriteFile(int)} etc.
   * <li>2013-03-31 Hartmut chg: Event<Type>
   * <li>2012-11-16 Hartmut chg: Usage of {@link CmdEvent#filesrc} and filedst and {@link CallbackEvent#filedst} and dst
   *   instead {@link EventCmdtypeWithBackEvent#getRefData()}.
   * <li>2012-11-11 Hartmut chg: The flag bit {@link #mDirectory} should be set always, especially also though {@link #mTested} is false.
   *   That should be assured by the {@link FileRemoteAccessor} implementation.
   * <li>2012-10-01 Hartmut chg: {@link #children} is now of super type File, not FileRemote. Nevertheless FileRemote objects
   *   are stored there. Experience is possible to store a File object returned from File.listFiles without wrapping, and
   *   replace that with a FileRemote object if necessary. listFiles() returns a File[] like its super method.
   * <li>2012-10-01 Hartmut new: {@link #isTested()}  
   * <li>2012-08-11 Hartmut new: method {@link #openInputStream(long)}. An application may need that, for example to create
   *   a {@link java.io.Reader} with the input stream. Some implementations, especially a local file and a {@link java.util.zip.ZipFile}
   *   supports that. An {@link java.io.InputStream} may force a blocking if data are not available yet for file in a remote device
   *   but that may be accepted. 
   * <li> 2012-08-11 Hartmut new: {@link #listFiles(FileFilter)} now implemented here. 
   * <li>2012-08-05 Hartmut chg: The super class File needs the correct path. So it is able to use for a local file nevertheless.
   *   What is with oFile if it is a FileRemote? should refer this? See change from 2012-01-01.
   * <li>2012-08-03 Hartmut chg: Usage of Event in FileRemote. 
   *   The FileRemoteAccessor.Commission is removed yet. The same instance FileRemote.Callback, now named FileRemote.FileRemoteEvent is used for forward event (commision) and back event.
   * <li>2012-07-28 Hartmut chg: Concept of remote files enhanced with respect to {@link FileAccessZip}.
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>New references {@link #parent} and {@link #children}. They are filled calling {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}.
   *   <li>More separation of java.io.File accesses. In the past only the local files were supported really.
   *   <li>new interface {@link FileRemoteAccessorSelector} and {@link #setAccessorSelector(FileRemoteAccessorSelector)}.
   *     The user can have any algorithm to select a {@link FileRemoteAccessor} depending on the
   *     path of the file. A prefix String may determine how the file is to access. If that routine
   *     is not called, the {@link FileAccessorLocalJava7#selectLocalFileAlways}.
   *   <li>{@link #FileRemote(FileRemoteAccessor, FileRemote, String, String, long, long, int, Object)}
   *     has the parent as parameter. The parameter oFileP is stored now. It is any data to access the file object.
   *   <li>The constructor had access the file if length=-1 was given. But that is not the convention.
   *     An access may need execution and waiting time for a remote communication. The constructor
   *     should never wait. Instead the methods:
   *   <li>{@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)} and {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}
   *     have to be called if the properties of the real file on the local system (java.io.File)
   *     or any remote system are need. That routines envisages the continuation of working
   *     with a callback event are invocation mechanism. For example if the file properties
   *     should be shown in a graphic application, the building of the graphic can't stop and wait 
   *     for more as some 100 milliseconds. It is better to clear a table and continue working in graphic. 
   *     If the properties are gotten from the remote system then the table will be filled.
   *     That may be invoked from another thread, the communication thread for the remote device
   *     or by an event mechanism (see {@link FileRemote.CallbackEvent} respectively {@link org.vishia.event.EventCmdtypeWithBackEvent}.
   *   <li>The routine {@link #fromFile(File)} reads are properties of a local file if one is given.
   *     In that case the {@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)} need not be invoked additionally.
   *   <li>{@link #openRead(long)} and {@link #openWrite(long)} accepts a non-given device.
   *     They select it calling {@link FileRemoteAccessorSelector#selectFileRemoteAccessor(String)}
   *   <li>All get methods {@link #length}, {@link #lastModified()}, {@link #isDirectory()} etc.
   *     now returns only the stored values. It may necessary to invoke {@link #refreshProperties(CallbackEvent)}
   *     in the application before they are called to get the correct values. The refreshing
   *     can't be called in that getter routines because they should not wait for communication.
   *     In the case of local files that access may be shorten in time, but it isn't known
   *     whether it is a local file. The user algorithm should work with remote files too if they are
   *     tested locally only. Therefore a different strategy to access properties are not proper to use.
   *   <li>{@link #getParentFile()} now uses the {@link #parent} reference. If it is null,
   *     a new FileRemote instance for the parent is created, but without access to the file,
   *     only with knowledge of the path string. Because the {@link #FileRemote(FileRemoteAccessor, FileRemote, String, String, long, long, int, Object)}
   *     will be gotten the parent of it too, all parent instances will be set recursively then.
   *   <li>{@link #listFiles()} now returns the {@link #children} only. If the user has not called
   *     {@link #refreshPropertiesAndChildren(CallbackEvent)}, it is empty.           
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2012-07-21 Hartmut new: {@link #delete(String, boolean, EventCmdtypeWithBackEvent)} with given mask. TODO: It should done in 
   *   {@link org.vishia.fileLocalAccessor.FileAccessorLocalJava7} in an extra thread.
   * <li>2012-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link #chgProps(String, int, int, long, CallbackEvent)}, {@link #countAllFileLength(CallbackEvent)}.
   *   Enhancements.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Now the {@link #sFile} (renamed from name) is empty if this describes
   *   an directory and it is known that it is an directory. The ctor is adapted therefore.
   *   {@link #getParent()} is changed. Some assertions are set.
   * <li>2012-02-02 Hartmut chg: Handling of relative paths: It is detected in ctor. TODO relative paths are not tested well. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut chg: The toplevel directory contains only one slash in the {@link #sDir}
   *   and an empty name in {@link #key}. 
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #getParentFile()} now implemented here.  
   * <li>2012-01-14 Hartmut new: {@link #fromFile(File)} to convert from a normal File instance.
   * <li>2012-01-06 Hartmut new: Some functionality for {@link #_setProperties(long, long, int, Object)}
   *   and symbolic linked paths.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #oFile}. In the future the superclass File should be used only as interface.
   *   TODO: For any file access the oFile-instance should be used by {@link #device}.
   * <li>2012-01-01 Hartmut new: {@link #copyTo(FileRemote, EventCmdPingPongType)}
   * <li>2011-12-10 Hartmut creation: It is needed for {@link org.vishia.commander.Fcmd}, this tool
   *   should work with remote files with any protocol for example FTP. But firstly it is implemented and tested
   *   only for local files. The concept is: 
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>All relevant information about a file are stored locally in this instance if they are known.
   *   <li>If information are unknown, on construction 'unknown' is stored, no access occurs.
   *     But if they are requested, an access is done.
   *   <li>Any instance of the interface {@link FileRemoteAccessor} is responsible to execute the remote access.
   *   <li>The access to local files are done with this class directly.
   *   </ul>

   * for the event is set with calling of {@link FileRemoteAccessor#prepareCmdEvent(CallbackEvent)}. 
   * That completes the given {@link CallbackEvent} with the necessary {@link CmdEvent} and its correct destination {@link EventConsumer}.
   * <br><br>
   * Some status messages and the success is notified from the other thread or remote device with invocation of the 
   * given {@link CallbackEvent}. After any status message was received the {@link CmdEvent} gotten as {@link EventCmdPingPongType#getOpponent()}
   * from the received {@link CallbackEvent} can be used to influence the copy process:
   * The commands of the callback are:
   * <ul>
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#done}: The last callback to designate the finish of succession.
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstNotAbletoOverwr}: The destination file exists and it is readonly. It can't be set writeable 
   *   though the {@link #modeCopyReadOnlyOverwrite} designation was sent in the mode argument. 
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstOverwr}: The destination file exits. 
   *   Because {@link #modeCopyExistAsk} is given it is the request for asking whether it should be overridden. 
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstReadonly}: The destination file exists and it is read only. 
   *   Because the {@link #modeCopyReadOnlyAks} is given it is the request for asking whether it should be overridden though.
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askErrorDstCreate}: The destination file does not exists or it exists and it is writeable or set writeable.
   *   Nevertheless the creation or replacement of the file (open for write) fails. It is possible that the medium is read only
   *   or the user has no write access to the directory. Usual the copy of that file should be skipped sending {@link Cmd#abortCopyFile}. 
   *   On the other hand the user can clarify what's happen and then send {@link Cmd#overwr} to repeat it. 
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstNotAbletoOverwr}: The destination file 
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstNotAbletoOverwr}: The destination file 
   * <li>{@link CallbackCmd#askDstNotAbletoOverwr}: The destination file
