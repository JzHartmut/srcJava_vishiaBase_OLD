   * <ul>
   * <li>2012-11-10 Hartmut chg: Name of this interface changed from Report to MainCmdLogging_ifc: The identifier Report
   *   may be bad understanding, this interface is used as a logging interface. A report is more a summary presentation.
   *   TODO: rename all methods which starts with report.
   * <li>2012-11-10 Hartmut inherits from LogMessage. This interface is used for log, but it contains some more.
   * <li>2012-03-30 Hartmut new {@link #getLogMessageErrorConsole()}
   * <li>2011-10-11 Hartmut new {@link #setOutputChannels(Appendable, Appendable)}. All outputs are redirect-able now.
   *   Used for output in a graphical text box.
   * <li>2007-12-29 Hartmut  some methods from mainCmd_ifc are displaced here. 
   *                 Thus the Report interface is revalued to write some informations also to the display
   *                 with the capability to control the report levels for that in the implementation.
