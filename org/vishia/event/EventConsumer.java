   * <ul>
   * <li>2015-01-04 Hartmut chg:It is an abstract class instead an interface yet for new data, less effort for adaption.
   *   New method {@link #shouldRun} which does not need to override in all implementation.
   * <li>2015-01-04 Hartmut chg: With the method {@link #getStateInfo()} any instance is able to quest for its state. 
   *   It may be an important method for debugging and showing.
   * <li>2013-05-11 Hartmut chg: It is an interface up to now. The idea to store a name for debugging on 
   *   anonymous overridden instances is able to implement with an <code>toString(){ return "name"}</code> alternatively.
   *   The method doProcessEvent is renamed to {@link #processEvent(EventMsg)}. 
   *   The advantage of interface: multi inheritance. 
   *   It is used as interface for {@link org.vishia.stateMachine.StateCompositeBase}.
   * <li>2013-04-07 Hartmut adap: Event<?,?> with 2 generic parameter
   * <li>2012-08-30 Hartmut new: This is an abstract class now instead of an interface. 
   *   The application should build an anonymous inner class with it. Because better debugging suppert 
   *   the class has a name which is present to the toString()-method of an event.
   * <li>2011-12-27 Hartmut created, concept of event queue, callback need for remote copy and delete of files
   *   (in another thread too). A adequate universal class in java.lang etc wasn't found.
