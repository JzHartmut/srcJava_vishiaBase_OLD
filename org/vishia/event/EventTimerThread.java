/**This class stores events, starts the processing of the events in one thread and manages and executes time orders in the same thread. 
 * An instance of this class is the main instance to execute state machines in one thread. 
 * The methods of this class except {@link #start()} and {@link #close()} are used from instances of {@link EventWithDst}, 
 * {@link EventTimeout} and {@link TimeOrder} internally.
 * They should not be invoked by an application directly. 
 * But if any other event derived from {@link java.util.EventObject} is used then the methods 
 * {@link #setStdEventProcessor(EventConsumer)}, {@link #storeEvent(EventObject)} and maybe {@link #removeFromQueue(EventObject)}
 * should be used. 
 * <br><br>
 * To instantiate and start use 
 * <pre>
 * 
  EventTimerThread myExecutionThread = new EventTimerThread("thread-name");
  myExecutionThread.start();
 * </pre>
 * On end of the application {@link #close()} should be invoked to end the thread.
 * <br><br>
 * To add any event of derived type of {@link EventWithDst} from any other thread use this instance as argument for the event: 
 * <pre>
 * 
  MyEventWithDst event = new MyEventWithDst(source, dst, myExecutionThread);
  //or:
  event.occupy(source, dst, myExecutionThread, ...)
  event.sendEvent();
 * </pre>
 * To add any other type of {@link java.util.EventObject} you should set a {@link #setStdEventProcessor(EventConsumer)}. 
 * Then use 
 * <pre>
 * 
  myExecutionThread.storeEvent(eventObject);
 * </pre>
 * This class is used as time manager too. It manages and executes {@link EventTimeout} 
 * which are used especially for {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine},
 * but it can execute {@link TimeOrder} in this thread too. To add a timeout event or a time order 
 * use the methods of the {@link EventTimeout#activateAt(long)} etc:
 * <pre>
 * 
  TimeOrder myTimeOrder = new TimeOrder("name", myExecutionThread) {
    QOverride protected void executeOrder(){ ...execution of the time order ...}
  };
  ...
  myTimeOrder.activate(100);  //in 100 milliseconds.
 * </pre> 
 * That routine invokes the routine {@link #addTimeOrder(EventTimeout)} of this class.
 * <br><br>
 * This class starts a thread. The thread sleeps if no event or time order is given. 
 * <br><br>
 * Events are stored in a {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue} which is thread-safe to enqueue events
 * from any thread with the method {@link #storeEvent(EventObject)}.
 * Then {@link Object#notify()} is called to weak up the thread if it sleeps. Then the all stored events are dequeued
 * and its execution routine of {@link EventConsumer#processEvent(EventObject)} is invoked. The events are processed one after another.
 * The execution routine is usual a {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine} but any other {@link EventConsumer} is able to use too. 
 * <br><br>
 * {@link TimeOrder} or {@link EventTimeout} are stored in another {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue}. 
 * The absolute time of the next execution is stored in the internal value of {@link #timeCheckNew}. The thread sleeps either
 * till this time is expired or till an event is given. If the time is expired all stored time orders are checked
 * whether its time is elapsed. Then either the {@link EventConsumer#processEvent(EventObject)} is invoked 
 * if an {@link EventTimeout} is given or a {@link TimeOrder} has a destination. Elsewhere the {@link TimeOrder#doExecute} 
 * is invoked to execute the {@link TimeOrder#executeOrder()} in this thread.
 * <br><br>
 * An event can be removed from the queue if it is not executed up to now. The routine {@link #removeFromQueue(EventObject)}
 * is invoked if an event should be {@link EventWithDst#occupyRecall(EventSource, boolean)}. That is if the event should be used
 * newly.
 * <br><br>
 * A time order or timeout event can be removed from execution with the method EventTimeout  {@link EventTimeout#deactivate()}.
 * This routine calls {@link #removeTimeOrder(EventTimeout)}.
