/**This class is a ready-to-use timeout event for state machines or the base class for time orders.
 * <br>
 * An EventTimeout is used inside {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine} as persistent instance 
 * of a parallel state machine or of the top state if timeouts are used in the states.
 * <br>
 * Instantiation pattern:<pre>
 *   EventThread thread = new EventThread("stateThread");
 *   //uses the thread as timer manager and as event executer
 *   EventTimeout timeout = new EventTimeout(stateMachine, thread);
 * </pre>
 * Activate the timeout event:<pre>
 *   timeout.activate(7000);  //in 7 seconds.
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Constructors: {@link EventTimeout#EventTimeout(EventConsumer, EventThread)}, {@link EventTimeout#EventTimeout()}.
 * <li>methods to activate: {@link #activate(int)}, {@link #activateAt(long)}, {@link #activateAt(long, long)}
 * <li>Remove a currently timeout: {@link #deactivate()}
 * <li>Check: {@link #timeExecution()}, {@link #timeExecutionLatest()}, {@link #timeToExecution()} {@link #used()}
 * <li>see {@link EventTimeOrder}.
 * <li>see {@link EventThread}
 * <li>see {@link org.vishia.states.StateMachine}
