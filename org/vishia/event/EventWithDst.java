  /**Version, history and license
   * <ul>
   * <li>2015-01-03 Hartmut chg: Separated in 2 classes: {@link EventCmdtypeWithBackEvent} with opponent and this class.
   *   A simple event has not an opponent per default. This class is named EventWithDst yet because the destination
   *   is the significant difference to its base class {@link java.util.EventObject}.
   * <li>2015-01-03 Hartmut chg: Renamed to EventMsg: more significant name. Derived from EventObject: A basicly Java concept.
   * <li>2013-10-06 Hartmut chg: Some checks for thread safety.
   * <li>2013-10-06 Hartmut chg: {@link #occupy(int, EventSource, EventConsumer, EventTimerThread)} with timeout
   * <li>2013-10-06 Hartmut chg: {@link #occupyRecall(EventSource, boolean)} return 0,1,2, not boolean.
   *   The state whether the recalled event is processed or it is only removed from the queued, may
   *   be important for usage. 
   * <li>2013-05-11 Hartmut new: {@link #Event(Enum)} to create an event for direct usage.
   *   {@link #cmde} does not need to be an Atomic, because {@link #dateCreation} is Atomic
   *   to designate the occupy-state of the event. 
   * <li>2013-04-12 Hartmut chg: Gardening. The attributes data1, data2, oData, refData are removed. Any special data
   *   should be defined in any derived instance of the event. A common universal data concept may be error-prone
   *   because unspecified types and meanings.
   * <li>2013-04-07 Hartmut chg: The Event class has 2 generic parameters up to now, the second for the opponent Event. 
   * <li>2012-11-16 Hartmut chg: An event is not occupied on construction if either the src or the dst is null. 
   *   Only if both references are given, it is occupied by construction.
   * <li>2012-09-12 Hartmut new: {@link #sendEventAgain()} for deferred events.
   * <li>2012-09-03 Hartmut chg: using {@link DateOrder} to log the date in milliseconds and the order as fine number.
   *   The order of events should be known. The timestamp is imprecise!
   * <li>2012-08-30 Hartmut new:  Some substantial enhancements for usage:
   *   <ul>
   *   <li>re-engineering for {@link #occupy(EventSource, boolean)}
   *   <li>Test and simplification of some use cases.
   *   <li>Meaning of the source of events, debug helping
   *   <li>documentation
   *   </ul>
   * <li>2012-08-03 Hartmut chg: Usage of Event in FileRemote. The event has more elements for forward and backward now.
   * <li>2012-07-28 renamed src, now {@link #refData}. It is not the source (creator) of the event
   *   but a value reference which may be used especially in the callback ({@link #callback}).
   *   Because it is private and the getter method {@link #getRefData()} is duplicated, the
   *   old routine {@link #getSrc()} is deprecated, it is downward compatible still. 
   * <li>2012-03-10 Hartmut new: {@link #owner}, {@link #forceRelease()}. 
   *   It is a problem if a request may be crashed in a remote device, but the event is reserved 
   *   for answer in the proxy. It should be freed. Events may be re-used. 
   * <li>2012-01-22 Hartmut chg: {@link #use(long, int, Object, EventConsumer)} needs the dst as parameter.
   * <li>2012-01-05 Hartmut improved: {@link #callbackThread}, {@link #commisionId} instead order, more {@link #data2} 
   * <li>2011-12-27 Hartmut created, concept of event queue, callback need for remote copy and delete of files
   *   (in another thread too). A adequate universal class in java.lang etc wasn't found.
